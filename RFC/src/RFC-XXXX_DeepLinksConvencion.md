## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to specify the deep links structure used in the Tari Aurora project.
The primary motivation is to create a simple, human-readable, and scalable way to structure deep links used by the Tari Aurora clients.

## Description

Deep links are the URIs with hierarchical components sequence. We can use this sequence to pass and handle data in a standardized and predictable way. To do that, we need to pass three components to the target client:

#### Scheme
The scheme is used to address the client, which will handle the data from the command and data component. In the Tari Aurora project, we're using `tari` scheme to open the wallet app and handle provided data.

#### Command
The command an optional component used to pass information about the action that should be performed by the client. The handler can use this info to determine which parser/decoder should be used to serialize data and what the app suppose to do with the data afterward.

For simple actions, the command can be defined as a single phrase. For more complex actions, the command should be defined as a multi-path where the first path component should be the name of the action group.

**Examples**:

Simple Actions:
```
user_profile
login
```
Complex Actions:
```
payment/send
payment/request
```

#### Data
The data component is a string of key-value pairs used by the parser/decoder to serialize the data, which the client will later use to handle the action. The data component should be formatted in the same way as a URL query. The sub-component should have a `?` prefix, the key-value pairs should be separated by `&`, and every key should be separated from the value by `=` character.

#### The Structure
Combining all three components, they will form a deep link with a structure presented below:
```
{scheme}://{command}?{data}
```
**Examples**:
```
tari://profile
tari://profile/username
tari://payment/send?amount=1.23&pubKey=01234556789abcde
```
